# The-L-Game
This is a project to learn go lang and develop a study of the L game.


## Discription
The L game is a two-player game played on a board of 4×4 squares. Each player has a 3×2 L-shaped, and there are two 1×1 neutral pieces.

## Rules of the Game
On each turn, a player must first move their L piece, and then may optionally move either one of the neutral pieces. The game is won by leaving the opponent unable to move their L piece to a new position.

#### 1. Pieces may not overlap or cover other pieces. 
#### 2. Moving the L piece.
A player picks up their piece and places it in an empty square. It may be rotated or even flipped over in doing so; the only rule is that it must end in a different position from the position it started—thus covering at least one square it did not previously cover. 
#### 3. Moving the Neutral piece
A player simply picks it up then places it in an empty square anywhere on the board.
